# Contributing

This repo is intentionally opinionated and a bit blunt. That’s on purpose.

## What makes a good contribution
- A concrete failure mode (“this breaks when…”), followed by a **small** fix.
- Checklists that are short enough to actually run.
- Templates that reduce thinking during an incident.
- “Minimum viable” versions for solo operators.

## What we won’t merge
- Big tool roundups with affiliate energy.
- Boilerplate policy docs that nobody reads.
- Anything that implies a private codebase or internal system.

## Style
- Write like an engineer.
- Prefer short sections.
- Use placeholders for domains/hosts/ports/endpoints:
  - `example.com`
  - `203.0.113.10`
  - `1234`
  - `/api/<redacted>`
